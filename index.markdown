I am an Assistant Professor of Public Policy at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. I graduated from Stanford University in 2022 with a Ph.D. in Economics. In the past, I have worked at Chegg and Microsoft Research, and served as a research advisor at Meta. Before graduate school, I worked as an RA at the New York Federal Reserve. For the 2022-23 academic year, I was a post-doctoral fellow at the NBER.

My research interests lie in industrial organization, with applications to college behavior in post-secondary education, firearms markets, and how machine learning methods can be used to enhance existing economic models.
