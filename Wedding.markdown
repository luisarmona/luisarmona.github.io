Francis and I are so excited to celebrate our wedding with you both! The primary event will be a reception starting at 6pm in Brooklyn. It will be somewhat informal in the sense that  we will not have arranged seating, instead opting for tapas being served throughout the night, and some pizza at the end. We recommend you eat a late-ish lunch before the wedding!


Please RSVP your attendance [here]() by no later than February 15, 2026.
